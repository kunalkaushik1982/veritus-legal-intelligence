The Customs Authorities took action under section 167, clause (8), of the Sea Customs Act VIII of 1878, and confiscated the gold by an order dated the 19th December, 1949.

    "petitioner_arguments": "The appellant argued that he had already been prosecuted and punished for the same offence when proceedings were taken by the Sea Customs Authorities. Therefore, he contended that his subsequent prosecution in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, was in violation of the fundamental right guaranteed to him under Article 20(2) of the Constitution, which prohibits double jeopardy.",
    "respondent_arguments": "The respondent, the State of Bombay, argued that the proceedings before the Sea Customs Authorities did not constitute a \"prosecution\" and the order for confiscation was not a \"punishment\" within the meaning of Article 20(2) of the Constitution.

    "courts_reasoning": "The Court reasoned that the wording of Article 20 of the Constitution and the words used therein show that the proceedings therein contemplated are proceedings of the nature of criminal proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal.

    "conclusion": "The Court concluded that the appellant's prosecution under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act was not barred by Article 20(2) of the Constitution. The ratio decidendi of the case is that for the protection of Article 20(2) to be invoked, the previous proceedings must constitute a \"prosecution\" and the order must be a \"punishment\" within the meaning of this constitutional provision. The Court ordered that the case should go back to the Chief Presidency Magistrate for disposal according to law."
